```
2) Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install

```

3) Start the app:

- Send SMS: `/send-sms`
- Process Control: `/process-control`
- Country Operator Management: `/country-operator-management`
- DB Connection Test: `/db-connection-test`

## API Integration

he app uses an API service (`services/api.js`) to interact with backend functions. Ensure that the API server is running and endpoints are correctly defined.

- Send SMS: `sendSMS(data)`
- Process Control: `startSession(data)`, `stopSession(data)`, `restartSession(data)`
- Country Operator Management: `addCountryOperator(data)`, `getCountryOperators()`
- DB Connection Test: `DB Connection Test: `

## Components

- **SMSForm:** Form to input and send SMS messages.
- **ProcessControl:** Start, stop, and restart processes by session and program name.
- **CountryOperatorManagement:** Add and display operators for different countries, with a priority option.
- **DBConnectionTest:** Test and display the status of the database connection.

Each component is designed to interact with the API and update the UI based on the response.

## Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling, providing responsive and modern UI elements:

- `Background Gradient:` Main app background with a light blue gradient (bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-100 to-blue-300).
- `Responsive Navigation:` A responsive navbar with hover effects for navigation between features.
- `Status Feedback:` Conditional styling in components for success/error feedback.
